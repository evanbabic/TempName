    Given the following handwritten notes, extract structured information in JSON format. The response should be divided into 4 sections:

    Notes: {extracted_text}

    Do not include any formatting (ie. including ```json at the start) that could mess with parsing.

    **1 Summary:**
    - Provide a concise, well-structured summary of the key learnings.

    **2 Key Points:**
    - List **5** of the most crucial details in bullet points.

    **3 Questions & Hints:**
    - Generate **three** thought-provoking questions about the topic.
    - Provide a hint for each question along with a related resource link.

    **4 Next Topics & Relations:**
    - Suggest **two** directly related topics.
    - Explain why each is relevant to the current topic.
